                <h2>Learning to Code</h2>
                <p>Learning to code is so much harder to apply outside of a learning environment. 

                    I got all sorts of advice from online resources when I was first starting to code about “don’t just copy projects, build your own” and I tried to stick with that. 
                    
                    I wish I’d done a few things as a strict copy at first. Because this whole coding from scratch thing is so much harder than I feel like it needs to be, simply because I have never actually SEEN some of this code. 
                    
                    Anybody else? 
                    
                    Yes, I realize I haven’t coded a comment box yet, but this is how I write, so roll with me here.</p>
